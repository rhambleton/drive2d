# Overview
This is an effort to create a 2D, side scrolling, physics based driving game.

# Current progress
Randomly generated track map is drawn
Can move around the map using w,s,a,d controls.

# Future Goals
add car model with realistic physics
implement vehicle controls and movement
implement saving/loading levels
implement scenery
implement obstacles (other than the track itself)
implement touch screen controls / mobile
implement HUD
implement scoring
implement multiple vehicles
implement 'economy' system and vehicle upgrades and coins to collect
implement speed based 'zoom'
