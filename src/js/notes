started a the physics model
just working on 1 wheel for now (to get the basic model sorted out)

what isn't working (almost everything)
- air friction / rolling resistance
- gravity
- normal force between road and wheel (which makes the wheel follow the path)
- friction of road against ground/grip/wheel spin/etc.
- lots of other things!!
