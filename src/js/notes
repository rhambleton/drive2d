collision detection with the track needs work
- on hills we should work from the maximum/minimum X rather than the center point

we need to implement angular momentum of the wheel
- if the wheel already has an angular velocity, it should play a role in the force balance....how do we do that?

need to integrate wheel into vehicle
- forces should be updated at the wheel level
- wheel spin rotation should be updated at the wheel level
- vehicle motion and rotation (including wheel position) will need to be done at the vehicle level
- vehicle rotation due to velocity (alpha = velocity / radius) needs to be done at the vehicle level
