straight/level rolling now works fairly well!
- no slipping, even when there should be

collision detection with the track needs work
- if dist < radius, then we need to relocate the wheel so dist = radius

somethings wrong - velocity resets to 0 when no force is applied
- it should carry over....

we need to implement angular momentum of the wheel
- if the wheel already has an angular velocity, it should play a role in the force balance....how do we do that?

wheel spin when the wheel is in the air feels weird - too aggressive.
- need to implement friction to slow the wheel down the drive is removed
