straight/level rolling now works fairly well!
- no slipping, even when there should be

collision detection with the track needs work
- if dist < radius, then we need to relocate the wheel so dist = radius
- perhaps return an object rather than just 'false' or the angle something like
	{true, angle}
	{false, distance}

we need to implement angular momentum of the wheel
- if the wheel already has an angular velocity, it should play a role in the force balance....how do we do that?

wheel spin when the wheel is in the air feels weird - too aggressive.
- need to implement friction to slow the wheel down the drive is removed
